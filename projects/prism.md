Starting as a research project with ATLAS faculty member Dr. Annie Margaret, this project led to the founding of the Post-Internet Project and is now in development for full integration into the platform. My primary role was data scientist, where I cleaned, analyzed, and modeled data to gain insight into key questions. 

Key questions:
1. How do specific social media behaviors relate to outcomes of wellbeing?
2. What strategies are most and least effective at engendering improvement with social media?
3. What patterns do we see among participants that may shed light onto specific strategies of change that would be most effective, and can we predict what those strategies would be for new participants?

Other details:

What exactly is it?
PRISM is an educational curriculum intended to help young people ages 13-18 improve their personal relationships with smartphones and social media. It is based on scientific research and has been proven to be an effective intervention for reducing addiction levels of social media use.

How does it work?
With PRISM, participants undertake a social media challenge, where they spend time reflecting on their current relationship with social media and set their own goals for changes they would like to make. Over the course of four weeks, participants i) self-report their success in adhering to their goals, ii) reflect on their feelings and experiences, and iii) complete surveys related to social media addiction and other mental health outcomes, all while learning about the complexities of modern technology, human psychology, and healthy behaviors.
