<h1 id="social-media-challenge-data-analysis">Social Media Challenge: <br />Data Analysis</h1>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>

<p>In this analysis, we take first steps towards insight into how social media behaviors differentially relate to outcomes of well-being by analyzing a novel data set collected from 576 college students who participated in a four-week, self-directed social media challenge. It contains free response data about social media behaviors, self-directed goals for change, a number of survey items related to well-being, and weekly self-reported success scores. With this rich dataset, we are uniquely positioned to better understand how outcomes of well-being may relate to different patterns of social media use, how some forms of goal-setting may be more effective than others for improving social media behavior, and whether a simple reduction of time spent on social media is a realistic goal in the social fabric of the modern world, which is increasingly facilitated by online interactions.</p>

<h4 id="project-scope">Project Scope</h4>

<p>This project primarily focuses on the <b><i>initial data anlysis</i></b> performed on the social media challenge dataset. We focus primarily on relationships between variables and patterns of success as it relates to reducing social media addiction scores as measured by the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). Note that further steps were taken with this data and those details can be found elsewhere, specifically in the <a href="prism">PRISM</a> and <a href="smc-annotations">SMC Annotations</a> projects.</p>

<h4 id="data">Data</h4>

<p>Our data was collected from six semesters of college students who participated in a social media cleanse challenge (n=2607, N=576). All data was de-identified prior to any analysis. At the start of the challenge, each student was asked to reflect on their personal relationship with social media, determine appropriate goals to improve their social media behavior, and then commit to a four-week self-directed effort in intentional behavior change. Students would check in once a week to complete a set of surveys related to their well-being and stress, report their success in sticking to their goals, and write a reflection on the previous week. A full table of included surveys can be found below in Table 1.</p>

    <img src="../assets/img/projects/smc-analysis/psych-surveys.png" />
    <figcaption>Table 1. Psychological Surveys</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Note that the surveys administered for each semester changed over time so that not every student completed every survey. Table 2. quantifies which surveys were administered across each of the six semesters.</p>

    <figcaption>Table 2. Psychological Surveys</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><br /></p>

<p>While each student ideally completed five rounds of surveys (an initial survey and four follow-up surveys), many completed fewer. The distribution of completed surveys can be seen below. Participants with fewer than the complete five surveys were either kept or removed from consideration depending on the analysis being conducted.</p>

<h4 id="wellbeing-and-social-media">Wellbeing and Social Media</h4>

<p>We start the investigation by asking the high-level question: what is the relationship between social media and wellbeing?</p>

<h5 id="wellbeing-and-social-media-addiction">Wellbeing and Social Media Addiction</h5>

<p>To start, we investigate the relationship between addiction (BSMAS) and the other surveys that relate to outcomes of wellbeing. We do this by looking at the pearson correlation (\(\rho\)) between the participant mean scores of the surveys and their BSMAS levels. Below is a table of correlations sorted by descending magnitude.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../assets/img/projects/smc-analysis/bsmas-corr.png" />
    <figcaption>Table 4. Mean BSMAS &amp; Survey Correlations </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From this table, we can group correlations into three categories: moderate-strong (\(\rho \gt 0.3\)), moderate-weak (\(0.3 \gt \rho \gt 0.5\)), and weak (\(\rho \lt 0.15\)). The weak correlations indicate no clear linear relationship between mean BSMAS and the mean survey score, and so I will not discuss them further.</p>

<h6 id="moderate-strong-correlations">Moderate-Strong Correlations</h6>
<ul>
  <li><b><u>SoNA</u></b>: Sense of Negative Agency
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=0.496\))</li>
      <li>The strong correlation with social media addiction is sense of negative agency, and this makes sense to intuition! Addiction undermines choice and agency by coopting the reward circuitry in the brain. Addicts report feeling as if they are not in control of their actions, and it appears that that pattern holds strongly for social media addicts as well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>ADTS Anx</u></b>: Anxious Attitudes Towards Technology
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=0.436\))</li>
      <li>Anxious attitudes towards tech also has a strong correlation with addiction. This indicates that those addicted to social media may be experiencing more anxiety as a result, or use social media as relief from anxiety, or some combination of the two.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>PSS</u></b>: Perceived Stress
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=0.394\))</li>
      <li>Perceived stress likely shares a similar story with anxious attitudes in its relationship with social media addiction. Those with a heightened sense of stress may seek respite in social media, or they may experience more stress as a result of their addiction to social media, or some combination of both.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>ChQ</u></b>: Change Questionnaire
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=0.334\))</li>
      <li>Finally, we see a moderate-strong correlation between desire and motivation to change and social media addiction. This could suggest that those with social media addiction issues may themselves sense that something is “off” and consequently desire to change. Alternatively, time spent on social media could be making them feel unsatisfied with their lives, thus motivating change.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h6 id="moderate-weak-correlations">Moderate-Weak Correlations</h6>
<ul>
  <li><b><u>SWLS</u></b>: Life Satisfaction
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=-0.210\))</li>
      <li>Negatively correlated with social media addiction is life satisfaction. Perhaps low life satisfaction can lead to social media addiction or vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>ADTS Neg</u></b>: Negative Attitudes Towards Technology
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=0.206\))</li>
      <li>The correlation between negative attitudes towards technology and social media addiction suggests that those who have a low opinion of technology may also be at higher risk of addiction to it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b><u>SoPA</u></b>: Sense of Positive Agency
    <ul>
      <li>(\(\rho=-0.172\))</li>
      <li>Finally, we see a negative correlation between social media addiction and a sense of positive agency. This is expected, because as was described above, addiction and agency typically do not coincide.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="wellbeing-and-social-media-platform">Wellbeing and Social Media Platform</h5>

<p>What about the relationship between wellbeing and the specific social media platforms? Are some better or worse than others? To get at this question, we correlate survey scores with social media platform indicator variables.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="../assets/img/projects/smc-analysis/corr-surveys-platforms.png" />
    <figcaption>Table 5. Survey Correlations with Social Media Platforms </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are too many correlations to discuss meaningfully here, so I will make just a few observations of what I believe to represent a larger pattern.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>There are clear differences between platforms with respect to wellbeing.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Take Reddit and TikTok. TikTok has the highest correlation with social media addiction compared to any other platform. Its associated with higher anxiety towards technology, lower self-esteem, lower sense of positive agency, and a higher sense of negative agency.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>There are tradeoffs in terms of wellbeing and social media platform choice.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>If we resume our comparison from above, for all of its merits, Reddit is also associated with low perceptions of social support whereas TikTok is associated with higher levels of social support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Social connection is highly varied across platforms.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Despite its name, <i>social</i> media doesn’t appear to be consistenty social. Some platforms may be better at fostering social connection than others (see PSOC correlations). Or, certain platforms may attract people who have fewer social ties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As mentioned before, there’s a lot more to get into here. Why is Facebook so strongly correlated with a sense of negative agency while instagram isn’t? Why are pinterest users so interested in change, while discord users are not? How often is there an overlap of useage between social media platforms? Which ones co-occur and which ones are usually mutually exclusive?</p>
