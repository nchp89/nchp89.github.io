<blockquote>
  <p>“<i>Walking, ideally, is a state in which the mind, the body, and the world are aligned, as though they were three characters finally in conversation together, three notes suddenly making a chord. Walking allows us to be in our bodies and in the world without being made busy by them.</i>”</p>

<h4 id="rhododenron-or">Rhododenron, OR</h4>

<p>It was a warm and sunny September day in Rhododendron, Oregon when Adam and Kylie pulled their rented Subaru into a dusty gravel parking lot. They woke in the dark of the early morning to catch a plane from Denver to Portland, and the interim 45 miles of highway from Portland International Airport were driven in a state of quiet anticipation.</p>

<p>Just over a month ago, Kylie, or Tang as she’s better known on the trail, was standing atop Mt. Katahdin deep in the wilderness of central Maine. She had just finished hiking the Appalachian Trail, the last of the three long trails she needed to complete one of the most prestigious achievements in the world of thru-hiking: The Triple Crown. Alongside her stood her partner Adam, or Chipotle as he’s known on trail. He had completed his Triple Crown less than a year before and came to join Kylie for the last few hundred miles of her effort. It was a moment neither of them would ever forget, and now, a few weeks later, they were sitting in a dusty parking lot in Rhododendron outside the venue of the Triple Crown Ceremony, the magnificent Mt. Hood standing proudly in the distance.</p>

<h4 id="thru-hiking-is-hard">Thru-hiking Is Hard</h4>

<p>Thru-hiking has a reputation of being a sport for misfits, and if you boil it down to its component parts, it’s a wonder that anybody chooses to do it at all. Who would want to carry a bunch of heavy equipment on their back and then trek into the wilderness for weeks on end? Such a person would spend all day sweating up steep inclines and pulverizing their knees on meandering descents. They’d get drenched in the rain and they’d shiver in the snow. They’d have to ration food and filter all of their water – that is, whenever they could find it. And at the end of the day, they wouldn’t get to shower and sleep in a soft bed. No, they’d crawl into a dirty sleeping bag and sleep in their accrued daily dirt and sweat on the hard ground. Oh, and did I mention that there are no bathrooms out in the wilderness? Even something as simple as relieving oneself turns into work, something to be planned and executed.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people who attempt thru-hiking promptly give up! Nearly a third of those who start the Appalachian Trail with full intent to stand on top of Mt. Katahdin themselves quit within the first 100 miles, and another third quit within the first 500. And yet, there remains the few that do make it all the way to Maine. These are members of a subculture that lives to live outside. When they’re on the trail, they feel alive. When they’re not, they’re thinking about when they will be back on the trail.</p>

<h4 id="trail-names">Trail Names</h4>

<p>Kylie and Adam are squarely in this latter group, as are the others in attendance at the Triple Crown Ceremony. Of course, in these circles, Kylie and Adam go by their trail names: Tang and Chipotle. A trail name is a funny, sacred thing. One’s given name is for the real world, but on trail, the real world is so distant that it may as well be ancient Mesopotamia. Out on trail one needs a different name for different circumstances. Trail names can be anything, but usually, they are bestowed by a companion who notices some personality quirk or witnesses some funny or strange happening. The aptly monikered Chipotle earned his title from his love of the chain restaurant of the same name. Chipotle estimates that he’s eaten Chipotle no less than 2000 times, and every time a new store opens up he is one of the first to try it out.</p>

<p>Other trail names aren’t so obvious. The origin of Tang’s trail name remains a mystery to most of those who know her, and she likes it that way. Shades, Sticks, Boomerang, All-You-Can-Eat, Double-Stuff, Longfish, Church, Thoroughbred, Scab, and Dirty-Girl are all names that invite speculation of epics and comedies. Kylie and Adam were happy to be in this room, among these people, and with them felt a deep sense of camaraderie. These people all get each other. They’ve seen what’s out there in the wilderness, and they understand why it’s worth pursuing.</p>

<h4 id="the-science-behind-walking">The Science Behind Walking</h4>

<h5 id="some-famous-walkers">Some Famous Walkers</h5>
<p>There is a long history of folks who found purpose along their walks in nature. Jean-Jaques Rousseau, Henry David Thoreau, William Wordsworth, Virginia Woolf, Charles Darwin, John Muir, and countless others discovered that walking through wilderness could be a source of inspiration and clarity – a way to not only know the world better, but to know oneself better, too.</p>

<h5 id="cognitive-health">Cognitive Health</h5>
<p>Reflect on your own life, dear reader. You yourself may have “gone on a walk to clear your head” or “taken a stroll to find room to think”. Indeed, there is a longstanding and important relationship between the mind and the feet that has become of scientific interest in recent years. Researchers have found that walking for as little as 90 minutes a week can decrease cognitive decline in elderly women, that walking for an hour on a treadmill prior to a divergent thinking test improved creativity scores by 60%, and that regular periods of walking can even increase the volume of the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center. The fact that walking, a simple, non-cognitive task, has such a wealth of benefits for our brain health is on its surface quite surprising. However, the story begins to make much more sense when we consider our ancient ancestors.</p>

<h5 id="evolutionary-biology">Evolutionary Biology</h5>
<p>Evolutionary biologists have much to say on walking and the brain, and many have gone so far as to credit our bipedalism as a necessary precursor to our high intelligence. The use of two legs rather than four, the thinking goes, resulted in two important changes in our evolutionary history: the development of our hands and more efficient ambulation. The development of hands entailed the development of complex manipulation – the exact kind of skill that required the use of cortical tissue, the brain matter associated with complex thought and reasoning. Additionally, more efficient ambulation meant that excess energy could be devoted to the brain rather than musculature.</p>

<p>Together, these changes formed a virtuous cycle. As our brains grew, we developed new skills and tools, like hunting and language. As our skills and tools developed, our species developed more efficient methods of collecting and storing resources. An excess amount of resources meant more energy could be devoted to the brain and its development. And so on. Summed up by the evolutionary biologist Mary Leaky,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“One cannot overemphasize the role of bipedalism in hominid development. It stands as perhaps the salient point that differentiates the forebears of man from other primates. This unique ability freed the hands for myriad possibilities - carrying, tool-making, intricate manipulation. From this single development, in fact, stems all modern technology. Somewhat oversimplified, the formula holds that this new freedom of forelimbs posed a challenge. The brain expanded to meet it. And mankind was formed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="a-way-of-life">A Way of Life</h4>

<p>Of course, none of this was on the minds of Kylie or Adam as they traded trail stories with the other Triple Crowners in that stuffy room in Rhododendron. Their brains may have benefited from the thousands of miles they spent on the trail, but brain health wasn’t ever on the list of reasons why they chose to hike thousands and thousands of miles. To them, being on trail was a way of life, something that was deeply challenging and fulfilling, something that simply wasn’t available in their day-to-day lives back home.</p>

<p>Thru-hiking engenders a clarity of purpose that has become all-too-rare in the modern world. When you wake in the morning nestled in your sleeping bag, early morning sun illuminating your colorful nylon cocoon, there is a very clear idea of what needs to be done, and that simplifies life to a delightful degree. What will you eat today? Whatever you have in your bag. How far will you walk? However far you need to go.  Who will you walk with? Whoever is walking in the same direction you are. Beyond these questions remain a few points of uncertainty, such as the afternoon weather or the quality of trail in the upcoming national forest, but life on the trail takes on a quality of streamlined unity – something notably lacking in much of modernity. As observed by the author Rebecca Solnit over twenty years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Many people nowadays live in a series of interiors - home, car, gym, office, shops - disconnected from each other. On foot everything stays connected, for while walking one occupies the spaces between those interiors in the same way one occupies those interiors. One lives in the whole world rather than in interiors built up against it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-triple-crown-ceremony">The Triple Crown Ceremony</h4>

<p>There were a series of guest speakers that afternoon in Rhododenron. Apple Pie, a well-known thru-hiker kicked things off with a few words of congratulations to the newest Triple Crowners, then she shared a personal anecdote from her time spent on the CDT. She described how she had lost her toilet paper right out of town just before a very remote part of the trail, so she had to use rocks to wipe herself for three days before finally encountering another hiker who mercifully donated some of his supplies to her. Adam laughed hard, though he had heard the story once before when he and Apple Pie hiked a leg of the AT together.</p>

<p>Later, a woman named Fidget spoke about her seven year hike from the southernmost tip of South America to the northernmost tip of North America - a 22,000 mile epic filled with stories of terror, compassion, and triumph. She shared a story of how she met a man in a small village as she hiked through Peru. He had taken a liking to her and offered his bread to take for her journey. However, she had learned earlier that the village was so poor that a loaf of bread was equivalent to an entire day’s worth of food. Not wanting him to starve over her, she refused his offer, believing that it was the most respectful action she could take, and the man accepted her decision with kindness. Her story was powerful, moving some to tears, but it was by no means unique. Each and every one of the hikers in the room that day had their own stories, their own experiences, their own lessons learned, but most would never be shared outside the circles of a few close friends and hiking partners.</p>

<h4 id="now-what">Now What?</h4>

<p>The Appalachian Trail is 2,200 miles long starting in Georgia and ending in Maine. The Pacific Crest Trail is 2,600 miles long starting in California and ending in Washington. The Continental Divide Trail is 3,100 miles long starting in New Mexico and ending in Montana. Together, they add up to nearly 8,000 miles in length. It takes some people their whole lives to complete the Triple Crown, while others make the (insane) attempt to complete it in a single year. Regardless of pace, it is an unbelievably impressive achievement, and it is no wonder that fewer than 700 people to date have officially completed it – about as many people who have been to space. At the conclusion of the ceremony, small wooden plaques were awarded to 2023’s batch of Triple Crowners – a tiny trophy next to the enormity of their achievement. Adam and Kylie have their plaques displayed next to each other on a shelf in their home. After such a massive achievement, I wondered what could be next for the two of them. Could they have quenched their thirst for adventure? I was happy to learn that the answer was a decisive no. Kylie plans on running 250 miles in three days in Arizona, and Adam wants to thru-hike the 500 mile-long Colorado Trail in 11 days. I wish both of them luck, and I look forward to the stories they bring back from these adventures.</p>
