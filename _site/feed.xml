<h1 id="reflection-on-just-starting-out">Reflection On Just Starting Out</h1>

<h4 id="the-return-home">The Return Home</h4>

<p>I remember stepping off the jetway into Lambert Airport in St. Louis, MO. The feeling was surreal. It was March of 2017 and I had just spent the last 13 months teaching English in South Korea.</p>

<p>The feeling of coming back home was a complicated one, a swirling mixture of sadness for the end of an amazing journey and excitement for the beginning of a new one. Soon I would see my family members who had been mere faces on a screen for the past year. Soon I would see my friends and learn about what they had been up to since I’d been gone. Soon I would be broke.</p>

<p>While Korea was a life-changing experience, it certainly was not a profitable one. I had a few thousand dollars saved. It was enough to last me four months if I stretched, but I needed more. I needed a job.</p>

<h4 id="launchcode">LaunchCode</h4>

<p>Luckily for me I had wisely chosen to study math and computer science in college, so I actually had a foundation of technical skills that could be cultivated to start a career. Plus, while I had been overseas I started to read about this new thing called “Data Science.” I wasn’t really sure what it meant exactly (I still wonder sometimes), but I knew it involved working with math, machine learning, and computers. Naturally, I was intrigued, so I began studying a little bit each day before going to work.</p>

<p>When I came back home I learned about a non-profit organization called <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a> through a friend of mine. Their mission was to get people working in tech based on their skills rather than their degrees. I put together a couple of sample projects to show what I could do and applied to their program. I was overjoyed when they accepted my application. Eventually they offered to place me in a 90-day internship in a new data science team at Graybar Electric, and I happily accepted!</p>

<h4 id="graybar">Graybar</h4>

<p>Those first few months at Graybar were spent cutting my teeth on code and collaboration. What I learned most during that time was just how different industry work operated compared to academic work. There weren’t any classes or grades or clubs. There was just our team and the projects that the team needed to get done.</p>

<p>I loved collaborating with others on difficult problems, and I could tell that I was learning quickly. I was lucky to find myself among a young and scrappy team, made up of other people like me who wanted to learn and prove they could do this kind of work well. It was composed of misfits who had tried their hand in some other discipline before pivoting into the exciting new field of data science, and at the head of this motley crew was my boss, Jeremy Salazar, who was the scrappiest of us all.</p>

<p>I truly enjoyed those first months working at Graybar, and I guess I proved something to them, because they offered me a job at the end of the internship. Less than 6 months after coming home, I had started a career in data science.</p>

<h4 id="gratitude">Gratitude</h4>

<p>As I write about this time in my life, I’m overcome with a sense of gratitude for having gotten the chances that have gotten me to where I am today. I was the beneficiary of the opportunities presented by Korea, LaunchCode, and Graybar, and I will always be grateful for having received them. After working at Graybar for a few years, another opportunity presented itself. I moved to Boulder, CO to begin a graduate education in Computer Science, but that’s for another post.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Hunkins</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Less Helpful Side of Self-Help</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/unhelpful-self-help" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Less Helpful Side of Self-Help" /><published>2024-03-12T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-03-12T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/unhelpful-self-help</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/unhelpful-self-help"><![CDATA[<head>

<h1 id="the-less-helpful-side-of-self-help">The Less Helpful Side of Self-Help</h1>

<h4 id="avoiding-the-self-help-trap">Avoiding the Self-help Trap</h4>

<p>Self-help is a popular genre for a reason. Nobody knows you better than yourself, so you require some help, why not take ownership over that process? This sounds great on its surface, but there is a pernicious side-effect to this project.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. Good things can come out of good self-help books. I’m grateful for having spent the time and energy to learn from books like Atomic Habits, Time Management for Mortals, and Deep Work, just to name a few. Smart people have smart ideas, who would have thought? In addition to the ideas themselves, reading self-help books can be deeply inspirational! You can have a better life, and here’s a new way to do it! Isn’t it wonderful to imagine? But, as is so often the case, there’s a dark side to this hopeful venture.</p>

<h4 id="problem-1-who-are-you">Problem 1: Who are you?</h4>
<p>Imagine that you’ve just purchased a self-help book at your local bookstore. Before you’ve even flipped open the cover, you’ve already made an implicit assumption: I need help, and this book has answers. With your purchase you have assumed a vulnerable mental stance and allotted the author a certain amount of trust.</p>

<p>This is a mistake. By design the book is written for a general audience – a general recipe for the average reader of the rough demographic the book was meant to target in its inception. The text may speak with authority, but its target audience is a caricature where you are a fully-fleshed human being.</p>

<p>The common strategy these books deploy is to simplify problems and then assert their correctness. In other words, they approach their reader with bravado and conveniently ignore the complexities of individual circumstances, the very complexities that give rise to life’s greatest difficulties and deepest questions.</p>

<h4 id="problem-2-youre-on-your-own">Problem 2: You’re on your own.</h4>
<p>Remember, the author does not know you, and they are not around to help you integrate all of their impressive ideas into your life. That leaves the job up to you, dear reader, to get yourself into shape! So, how will you manage it? Ask anybody whose great at what they do, and they’ll likely tell you that it can be very difficult to be your own coach.</p>

<p>How can you perform your best when you’re simultaneously looking over your own shoulder judging yourself? Inevitably, we simplify the situation by binarizing outcomes. We reckon that we either succeed or fail, and we forget that we can improve without doing it perfectly, or that sometimes a thing just doesn’t work for us. Instead of accepting these more obvious answers to our struggles, we tunnel vision on success and unintentionally undermine our own self-confidence with misplaced faith and perfectionism.</p>

<p>When you’ve fallen into this trap, it can very quickly turn into a downward spiral. You’ve got your bible, you’ve learned the gospel, and now you’re on a crusade towards perfection! Push harder! Read the book again! Do it exactly the way they wrote it! Because, if you were the kind of person who the author described (i.e., a successful person), then you should be able to do what they say and be happier for it. But… you’re not happier, so it must not be working, which means you must not be doing it right, which means you’re failing… Maybe you should buy a self-help book on self-discipline… or perhaps it was a lack of self-acceptance that led to your failure… Maybe you should buy books on both topics, just to be safe.</p>

<h4 id="problem-3-life-will-be-great-tomorrow">Problem 3: Life will be great tomorrow.</h4>
<p>The most pernicious challenge of self-help books is that it engenders a mindset of putting off one’s sense of wellbeing to an arbitrary time in the future. Once you get this time management system down, then you’ll be happy. Once you lose 30 pounds and get abs, then you’ll be happy. Once you can run a marathon, then you’ll be happy.</p>

<p>This is a problem. As anybody who has accomplished anything knows: happiness is fleeting. A first kiss lasts but a moment. You return to your seat after collecting your diploma. Eventually you drift off to sleep after the best night of your life. Wellbeing is predicated on contentment, and contentment must happen in the present moment where the content of real life actually exists. We must learn to be happy with what we already have, with who we already are. But the very concept of self-help books is that we can be better, and we should be better, and here’s a simple way to do it, and we should not compromise on our potential!</p>

<p>Consequently, too many self-help books promise more than they can deliver on. They offer grand promises of perfect productivity leading to the top of your career! An absolutely perfect training system that will lead you to smash records and be interviewed by Sports Illustrated. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with having a dream, but to pretend that a book can be a perfect road map to that dream and then conditioning one’s happiness on whether that dream is achieved is a recipe for disappointment and self-loathing. You couldn’t do it, and since you tried to do it by yourself, you have only yourself to blame, you loser.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I don’t want to dismiss the whole project of self-improvement as invalid. However, I think we should rethink our approach to the self-help genre by individually considering the following three points:</p>

<h5 id="know-your-circumstances">Know your circumstances</h5>
<p>First, we must recognize that the authors of these books cannot know our lives in any detail, so the burden falls to us to know what may or may not work for our unique circumstances.</p>

<h5 id="set-your-own-criteria">Set your own criteria</h5>
<p>Second, all of the work in interpretation and implementation of any self-help advice falls to us, the reader. Consequently, we must set the criteria for success and failure ourselves, with all their requisite gradients, while also maintaining the knowledge that nothing works for everyone.</p>

<h5 id="no-silver-bullet">No silver bullet</h5>
<p>Finally, no book (or anything else) is a silver bullet. We will never figure everything out, and any attempt to do so will inevitably breed more problems, which then need to be figured out, and so on. As such, we must remember to find contentment with ourselves now despite our shortcomings, and still strive to improve ourselves.</p>

<h4 id="final-word">Final Word</h4>
<p>While many self-help books offer legitimate advice, many others overpromise, underdeliver, repackage common sense, or veer off into something one could only consider obliquely helpful. As long as we recognize the limits of these books and exercise our personal agency, then we can keep what’s good about self-help while avoiding its dark side.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Hunkins</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Merits of Walking Really, Really Far</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/walking-really-far" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Merits of Walking Really, Really Far" /><published>2024-02-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-02-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/walking-really-far</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/walking-really-far"><![CDATA[<head>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<i>Walking, ideally, is a state in which the mind, the body, and the world are aligned, as though they were three characters finally in conversation together, three notes suddenly making a chord. Walking allows us to be in our bodies and in the world without being made busy by them.</i>”</p>

<h4 id="rhododenron-or">Rhododenron, OR</h4>

<p>It was a warm and sunny September day in Rhododendron, Oregon when Adam and Kylie pulled their rented Subaru into a dusty gravel parking lot. They woke in the dark of the early morning to catch a plane from Denver to Portland, and the interim 45 miles of highway from Portland International Airport were driven in a state of quiet anticipation.</p>

<p>Just over a month ago, Kylie, or Tang as she’s better known on the trail, was standing atop Mt. Katahdin deep in the wilderness of central Maine. She had just finished hiking the Appalachian Trail, the last of the three long trails she needed to complete one of the most prestigious achievements in the world of thru-hiking: The Triple Crown. Alongside her stood her partner Adam, or Chipotle as he’s known on trail. He had completed his Triple Crown less than a year before and came to join Kylie for the last few hundred miles of her effort. It was a moment neither of them would ever forget, and now, a few weeks later, they were sitting in a dusty parking lot in Rhododendron outside the venue of the Triple Crown Ceremony, the magnificent Mt. Hood standing proudly in the distance.</p>

<h4 id="thru-hiking-is-hard">Thru-hiking Is Hard</h4>

<p>Thru-hiking has a reputation of being a sport for misfits, and if you boil it down to its component parts, it’s a wonder that anybody chooses to do it at all. Who would want to carry a bunch of heavy equipment on their back and then trek into the wilderness for weeks on end? Such a person would spend all day sweating up steep inclines and pulverizing their knees on meandering descents. They’d get drenched in the rain and they’d shiver in the snow. They’d have to ration food and filter all of their water – that is, whenever they could find it. And at the end of the day, they wouldn’t get to shower and sleep in a soft bed. No, they’d crawl into a dirty sleeping bag and sleep in their accrued daily dirt and sweat on the hard ground. Oh, and did I mention that there are no bathrooms out in the wilderness? Even something as simple as relieving oneself turns into work, something to be planned and executed.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people who attempt thru-hiking promptly give up! Nearly a third of those who start the Appalachian Trail with full intent to stand on top of Mt. Katahdin themselves quit within the first 100 miles, and another third quit within the first 500. And yet, there remains the few that do make it all the way to Maine. These are members of a subculture that lives to live outside. When they’re on the trail, they feel alive. When they’re not, they’re thinking about when they will be back on the trail.</p>

<h4 id="trail-names">Trail Names</h4>

<p>Kylie and Adam are squarely in this latter group, as are the others in attendance at the Triple Crown Ceremony. Of course, in these circles, Kylie and Adam go by their trail names: Tang and Chipotle. A trail name is a funny, sacred thing. One’s given name is for the real world, but on trail, the real world is so distant that it may as well be ancient Mesopotamia. Out on trail one needs a different name for different circumstances. Trail names can be anything, but usually, they are bestowed by a companion who notices some personality quirk or witnesses some funny or strange happening. The aptly monikered Chipotle earned his title from his love of the chain restaurant of the same name. Chipotle estimates that he’s eaten Chipotle no less than 2000 times, and every time a new store opens up he is one of the first to try it out.</p>

<p>Other trail names aren’t so obvious. The origin of Tang’s trail name remains a mystery to most of those who know her, and she likes it that way. Shades, Sticks, Boomerang, All-You-Can-Eat, Double-Stuff, Longfish, Church, Thoroughbred, Scab, and Dirty-Girl are all names that invite speculation of epics and comedies. Kylie and Adam were happy to be in this room, among these people, and with them felt a deep sense of camaraderie. These people all get each other. They’ve seen what’s out there in the wilderness, and they understand why it’s worth pursuing.</p>

<h4 id="the-science-behind-walking">The Science Behind Walking</h4>

<h5 id="some-famous-walkers">Some Famous Walkers</h5>
<p>There is a long history of folks who found purpose along their walks in nature. Jean-Jaques Rousseau, Henry David Thoreau, William Wordsworth, Virginia Woolf, Charles Darwin, John Muir, and countless others discovered that walking through wilderness could be a source of inspiration and clarity – a way to not only know the world better, but to know oneself better, too.</p>

<h5 id="cognitive-health">Cognitive Health</h5>
<p>Reflect on your own life, dear reader. You yourself may have “gone on a walk to clear your head” or “taken a stroll to find room to think”. Indeed, there is a longstanding and important relationship between the mind and the feet that has become of scientific interest in recent years. Researchers have found that walking for as little as 90 minutes a week can decrease cognitive decline in elderly women, that walking for an hour on a treadmill prior to a divergent thinking test improved creativity scores by 60%, and that regular periods of walking can even increase the volume of the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center. The fact that walking, a simple, non-cognitive task, has such a wealth of benefits for our brain health is on its surface quite surprising. However, the story begins to make much more sense when we consider our ancient ancestors.</p>

<h5 id="evolutionary-biology">Evolutionary Biology</h5>
<p>Evolutionary biologists have much to say on walking and the brain, and many have gone so far as to credit our bipedalism as a necessary precursor to our high intelligence. The use of two legs rather than four, the thinking goes, resulted in two important changes in our evolutionary history: the development of our hands and more efficient ambulation. The development of hands entailed the development of complex manipulation – the exact kind of skill that required the use of cortical tissue, the brain matter associated with complex thought and reasoning. Additionally, more efficient ambulation meant that excess energy could be devoted to the brain rather than musculature.</p>

<p>Together, these changes formed a virtuous cycle. As our brains grew, we developed new skills and tools, like hunting and language. As our skills and tools developed, our species developed more efficient methods of collecting and storing resources. An excess amount of resources meant more energy could be devoted to the brain and its development. And so on. Summed up by the evolutionary biologist Mary Leaky,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“One cannot overemphasize the role of bipedalism in hominid development. It stands as perhaps the salient point that differentiates the forebears of man from other primates. This unique ability freed the hands for myriad possibilities - carrying, tool-making, intricate manipulation. From this single development, in fact, stems all modern technology. Somewhat oversimplified, the formula holds that this new freedom of forelimbs posed a challenge. The brain expanded to meet it. And mankind was formed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="a-way-of-life">A Way of Life</h4>

<p>Of course, none of this was on the minds of Kylie or Adam as they traded trail stories with the other Triple Crowners in that stuffy room in Rhododendron. Their brains may have benefited from the thousands of miles they spent on the trail, but brain health wasn’t ever on the list of reasons why they chose to hike thousands and thousands of miles. To them, being on trail was a way of life, something that was deeply challenging and fulfilling, something that simply wasn’t available in their day-to-day lives back home.</p>

<p>Thru-hiking engenders a clarity of purpose that has become all-too-rare in the modern world. When you wake in the morning nestled in your sleeping bag, early morning sun illuminating your colorful nylon cocoon, there is a very clear idea of what needs to be done, and that simplifies life to a delightful degree. What will you eat today? Whatever you have in your bag. How far will you walk? However far you need to go.  Who will you walk with? Whoever is walking in the same direction you are. Beyond these questions remain a few points of uncertainty, such as the afternoon weather or the quality of trail in the upcoming national forest, but life on the trail takes on a quality of streamlined unity – something notably lacking in much of modernity. As observed by the author Rebecca Solnit over twenty years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Many people nowadays live in a series of interiors - home, car, gym, office, shops - disconnected from each other. On foot everything stays connected, for while walking one occupies the spaces between those interiors in the same way one occupies those interiors. One lives in the whole world rather than in interiors built up against it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-triple-crown-ceremony">The Triple Crown Ceremony</h4>

<p>There were a series of guest speakers that afternoon in Rhododenron. Apple Pie, a well-known thru-hiker kicked things off with a few words of congratulations to the newest Triple Crowners, then she shared a personal anecdote from her time spent on the CDT. She described how she had lost her toilet paper right out of town just before a very remote part of the trail, so she had to use rocks to wipe herself for three days before finally encountering another hiker who mercifully donated some of his supplies to her. Adam laughed hard, though he had heard the story once before when he and Apple Pie hiked a leg of the AT together.</p>

<p>Later, a woman named Fidget spoke about her seven year hike from the southernmost tip of South America to the northernmost tip of North America - a 22,000 mile epic filled with stories of terror, compassion, and triumph. She shared a story of how she met a man in a small village as she hiked through Peru. He had taken a liking to her and offered his bread to take for her journey. However, she had learned earlier that the village was so poor that a loaf of bread was equivalent to an entire day’s worth of food. Not wanting him to starve over her, she refused his offer, believing that it was the most respectful action she could take, and the man accepted her decision with kindness. Her story was powerful, moving some to tears, but it was by no means unique. Each and every one of the hikers in the room that day had their own stories, their own experiences, their own lessons learned, but most would never be shared outside the circles of a few close friends and hiking partners.</p>

<h4 id="now-what">Now What?</h4>

<p>The Appalachian Trail is 2,200 miles long starting in Georgia and ending in Maine. The Pacific Crest Trail is 2,600 miles long starting in California and ending in Washington. The Continental Divide Trail is 3,100 miles long starting in New Mexico and ending in Montana. Together, they add up to nearly 8,000 miles in length. It takes some people their whole lives to complete the Triple Crown, while others make the (insane) attempt to complete it in a single year. Regardless of pace, it is an unbelievably impressive achievement, and it is no wonder that fewer than 700 people to date have officially completed it – about as many people who have been to space. At the conclusion of the ceremony, small wooden plaques were awarded to 2023’s batch of Triple Crowners – a tiny trophy next to the enormity of their achievement. Adam and Kylie have their plaques displayed next to each other on a shelf in their home. After such a massive achievement, I wondered what could be next for the two of them. Could they have quenched their thirst for adventure? I was happy to learn that the answer was a decisive no. Kylie plans on running 250 miles in three days in Arizona, and Adam wants to thru-hike the 500 mile-long Colorado Trail in 11 days. I wish both of them luck, and I look forward to the stories they bring back from these adventures.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Hunkins</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Our Attention Crisis</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/attention-crisis" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Our Attention Crisis" /><published>2022-05-02T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-05-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/attention-crisis</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/attention-crisis"><![CDATA[<head>

<h1 id="our-attention-crisis">Our Attention Crisis</h1>

<h4 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h4>

<p>We are living through an attention crisis. Despite all the progress we have made as a society, it seems we have lost our ability to focus. A study in 2014 found that the average college student switches tasks every 65 seconds [19]. Almost as bleak for office workers, another study found they only remain focused for about three minutes before switching tasks [6]. What’s going on here? In an age where people have a portal in their pocket to all human knowledge, where a wealth of information about nearly any obstacle can be accessed almost instantaneously, it would stand to reason that we should be more focused, not less. But, of course, nothing is so simple.</p>

<p>The information age has given rise to an unprecedented amount of content. For example, as of February 2020, more than 500 hours of video were uploaded to YouTube every minute [10]. The sheer quantity of content available online is far more than any one person could hope to meaningfully engage with. For the individual, this situation presents a need for effective navigation through a ceaselessly expanding ocean of information. For the purveyors of content, the challenge becomes attracting and holding attention. Some services accomplish this by providing quality content to their users in exchange for a subscription fee (e.g., Netflix), while others, like Facebook and YouTube, generate revenue through advertisements. This advertising model is most profitable when it captures as much time as possible from as many people as possible. To that end, these attention merchants (a term coined by Tim Wu in his book The Attention Merchants [18]) have discovered, developed, and deployed an array of tactics to distract us and gobble up our time, often using unethical practices.</p>

<p>In a world with so many things competing for our attention, we must stop and ask ourselves: what is it that we are paying attention to? William James, the American psychologist and father of pragmatism, once said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My experience is what I agree to attend to. Only those items which I notice shape my mind.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of our days, when we look back at our lives, we will remember our experience as the composition of all we attended to over the years. Simply put, the brief time we have on Earth is precious. Is it ethical to allow an entire industry to exploit our attention and consume our lives to increase their quarterly earnings? What can we do as individuals to better protect our attention and devote it to the things we find meaningful in our own lives? Whatever the answers may be, to adequately address either of these questions we must first understand how attention works.</p>

<h4 id="the-attentional-bottleneck">The Attentional Bottleneck</h4>

<p>The concept of attention has captivated some of our deepest thinkers throughout the ages. Today, it is a crucial area of investigation in many domains, such as education, psychology, and neuroscience. Attention can be conceptualized in many ways. Here, we define it as the behavioral and cognitive process of allocating limited cognitive resources by selectively concentrating on discrete aspects of information while ignoring other perceivable information. Effective allocation of cognitive resources is crucial, as the amount of information impinging on our senses far exceeds our processing capabilities, resulting in an attentional bottleneck. To illustrate, in human vision, less than 1% of available visual input information can enter the bottleneck, leading to a phenomenon known as inattentional blindness [16]. Indeed, vision and attention are closely linked (even mind-wandering, where internal attention has refocused on task irrelevant stimuli, can be predicted from eye movements [2]). Consequently, much of the research related to attention has placed an emphasis on visual attention.</p>

<p>There are two general models of visual attention. The first is known as the spotlight model, and it was inspired by the work of William James [8]. This model describes attention as having three parts: a focus, a margin, and a fringe. The focus of attention is high resolution, the center of which being where attention is directed. The focus is surrounded by a low-resolution zone called the fringe, which is then circumscribed by the margin of attention, or where attention is completely absent. The second model of visual attention is called the zoom lens model, and it inherits all the properties of the spotlight model with the added property of the focus changing in size [3] (similar to how a zoom lens on a camera works). The zoom lens feature accounts for the attentional bottleneck by assuming that attentional resources are fixed. In this model, it follows that the larger the area of focus is, the slower the processing of that region will be since the fixed resource is distributed over a larger area.</p>

<h4 id="sifting-through-the-infinite-haystack">Sifting Through the Infinite Haystack</h4>

<p>The attentional bottleneck presents a challenge for us in the modern world. Today’s deluge of content is flooding our senses (and inboxes) at an unprecedented pace.  As observed by Herbert A. Simon back in 1971:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it [15].”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, in our modern world of near infinite content, a need has emerged to efficiently connect people with the proverbial needle in the haystack. The tech giant Google made its name and fortune by creating a solution to this problem in the form of a search engine, a feat so well done that to ‘google’ something is itself a verb meaning to search for something on the internet. Search engines are great for users who can describe what they are looking for. But what about the users who want to discover something new? For them, recommendation systems have been a boon. Recommendation systems, like their name implies, offer recommendations of new content to a user based on that user’s history, such as the content they have viewed in the past (e.g., YouTube), what they’ve purchased (e.g., Amazon), or how they write their emails (e.g., Gmail autocomplete).  These systems can conveniently connect people with new content that they may have never encountered on their own.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for these innovations, several ethical concerns have been raised about these systems. Some believe that they may be subtly guiding users into echo chambers, driving tribalism, and fracturing our shared culture [9]. Others think that these systems learn to exploit cognitive biases in people and manipulate them into making decisions they wouldn’t otherwise make (e.g., impulse buying) [1]. While considering these ethical issues, we should remember that these systems are tools meant to assist our attention and guide it to what we find interesting, which begs the question: what is our attention drawn to? That is, how is attention oriented in our environment?</p>

<h4 id="may-stimul-i-have-your-attention">May Stimul-I Have Your Attention?</h4>

<p>There are two kind of cues (or stimuli) that attract attention: endogenous (i.e., central/internal) and exogenous (i.e., peripheral/external) [14]. Endogenous attention is the intentional allocation of cognitive resources and is typically oriented to one’s goals or desires. This goal-driven, or “top-down,” attention can be manipulated by the demands of a task that aligns with one’s intentions. Conversely, exogenous attention is guided through external processes and is responsive to stimuli in one’s environment. A sudden loud noise or movement in a shadowy bush attracts attention in a non-volitional way – a useful feature for our ancient ancestors. This non-volitional, or “bottom-up,” attention is reflexive, automatic, and stimulus driven.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, the attentional bottleneck makes it essential to have an effective strategy to attend to the most important aspects of the world around us. Endogenous and exogenous orientation, respectively driven by internal and external cues, ideally help us strike a balance between the demands of our inner goals and the constraints of our external environment. If there are relatively few constraints in the environment (e.g., there are no lions chasing us, we can pay our bills, we are healthy, etc.), then we have more cognitive resources to devote to our personal goals.</p>

<p>Humans, being social creatures, also have a particular sensitivity to social cues. For a person living in the distant past, it was crucial to survival that they be accepted by their tribe. Social acceptance meant food, shelter, status, and the chance to reproduce. Social rejection, on the other hand, was dangerous, and perhaps even fatal. Though the stakes aren’t as high as they once were, the biological infrastructure still exists in us today, and we still care deeply about what others think of us. Our attention is deeply intertwined with this fact, and the stimuli from our social environment are particularly salient, which may be one reason why social media has taken such a firm hold on so many people today.</p>

<h4 id="social-media-attention-merchantspirates">Social Media: Attention Merchants/Pirates</h4>

<p>Social connection has been one of the greatest drivers of the internet’s popularity since the 1990’s, with companies like America Online (AOL) selling itself as a place to connect with anybody in the world who has an internet connection. In the early and mid-2000’s, social media services began appearing, such as Friendster, MySpace, and Facebook. These platforms made big promises to bring people together in online communities, thus making friendships and connections possible for people living all over the planet. Even better, they were going to provide this service –- at least on the surface –- free of charge.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, platforms like Facebook are attention merchants. That is, they profit off the attention of their users by showing them advertisements. Facebook uses the illusion of social cues (e.g., the number of likes on a posted photo) and variable reward signals (e.g., randomly notifying users of their friend’s activity) to keep users coming back to check the platform and scroll through ads. Ironically, Facebook isn’t interested in social connections in the real world (what our social sensitivies developed for), because their goal is to maximize user engagement (i.e., people’s time and attention) with their platform. To an attention merchant like Facebook, people are products. They earn money from advertisers by delivering ads to eyeballs. The more ads they show and the more effective the advertising is, the more profitable they become. That is what they care about, because that is where the money is.</p>

<p>The fiscal interests of attention merchants are aligned with a two-pronged strategy: maximize engagement (i.e., time spent in the platform), and deliver targeted advertisements. To these ends, an enormous amount of effort is taken to collect data from users, often without their knowledge or consent. This data is then used to train algorithms that maximize user engagement and deliver targeted ads, an ethically questionable practice termed surveillance capitalism [20]. It should be obvious that this strategy is not necessarily aligned with beneficence, as there is no consideration of whether it provides useful (or even accurate) content. Indeed, this mindset of engagement above all else is exemplified in Nir Eyal’s book Hooked: How to Build Habit-forming Products [4].</p>

<h5 id="broken-promises">Broken Promises</h5>

<p>What modern social media platforms have turned into is a far cry from their original promise of bringing people together. As has been pointed out by people like Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin in their film The Social Dilemma [13], this business strategy is likely causing serious harm to the fabric of society as we know it by driving polarization and proliferating misinformation, and it all starts with the exploitation of human attention. Worse still, the strategy of engagement above all else forces other industries to abide by the same rules. For example, news outlets have become more and more polarized since the advent of social media, as they are incentivized to sell stories that engage rather than stories that are true. Consider the findings of a 2018 study conducted at MIT which found that false news spreads six time faster than true news on the social media platform Twitter [17].</p>

<p>The fact that our information space has been corrupted by this business model of surveillance capitalism should alarm anybody, yet any meaningful reform currently seems remote. The problem is nuanced enough that it takes real technical knowledge to address it, something lacking in most of today’s politicians. Additionally, there is no incentive for the businesses themselves to change and every reason to maintain the status quo, as they are thriving in the current environment. So, what is there to do?</p>

<h4 id="what-do-we-do">What Do We Do?</h4>

<p>With the endless flood of content available to us and an array of powerful entities competing for our eyes, it seems very difficult to protect our attention and use it for our own interests. Fortunately, there are several ways that we as individuals can defend ourselves.</p>

<h5 id="education">Education</h5>

<p>The first step is education. People like Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin, who were once Silicon Valley insiders, have made great efforts to broadcast the severity of the situation to the public, and have even started the non-profit Center for Humane Technology. Nir Eyal, mentioned before for his book Hooked, wrote another book titled Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life [5], in which he offers some practical solutions to protect one’s attention (ostensibly from the exploitative practices that he helped proliferate). Johann Hari took a broader perspective on the attention crisis in his book Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention – and How to Think Deeply Again [7], where he considers a range of factors including social media, the modern diet, and our culture’s obsession with speed and convenience.</p>

<h5 id="device-management">Device Management</h5>

<p>There is no shortage of resources for understanding this problem and its potential solutions. However, while these may offer some useful advice for protecting our attention, they are focused primarily on exogenous factors. It certainly helps to disable notifications and to turn our phones to grayscale, but these address only the hook. What about when our attention has already been captured? Identifying when our attention has gone to a place that isn’t serving us and then reorienting it to something that is aligned with our interests takes a certain degree of self-awareness and executive functioning. Luckily, there is a way to cultivate these skills.</p>

<h5 id="mindfulness-practice">Mindfulness Practice</h5>

<p>Within the western psychological context, mindfulness is usually described as non-judgmental awareness of the present moment and is thought to entail paying attention with a certain attitude [12].  Training and refining attention skills are central to most conceptualizations of mindfulness practices, which often takes place during meditation [11]. Developing mindfulness skills positively impacts attentional functions by improving the allocation of attentional resources, specifically during early stages of processing [12]. A common form of mindfulness practice is to place attention on one’s breath for a fixed period (e.g., 10 minutes), and, when the mind inevitably wanders, to recognize where attention has gone and then return it to the breath non-judgmentally. Repeating this process over and over again develops an ability to recognize when attention has been unintentionally captured. Aside from the wealth of benefits that mindfulness practices offer, this one is particularly useful for protecting our attention from those who seek to prey upon it. Whereas disabling notifications is a form of exogenous defense, mindfulness can be considered a form of endogenous defense, training our executive functioning to recognize and reorient away from stimuli that have captured our attention but have nothing of substance to offer.</p>

<p>It should be noted that just because mindfulness practice can breed a form of equanimity with the world as it is, that doesn’t mean the world should not change. While we as individuals can use exogenous and endogenous defense strategies to protect our attention, we must ask ourselves whether the industries that seek to harvest our attention should be entitled to such power over us to begin with.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Each of us has only a short time on Earth to do the things that we truly want to do, to live a life that is meaningful to us. This requires that we devote our time and attention to the things that matter most. But our attention, limited by the attentional bottleneck, can only be allocated to so many things. Attention merchants like Facebook further complicate the picture by exploiting our social sensitivities to attract and keep our attention to boost their bottom line. While human attention has been sought after for a long time, never has it been harvested at such a massive scale and with such impunity. Even though we as individuals can disable notifications on our phones and practice mindfulness to bolster our attentional defenses, there remain glaring ethical issues in the practices of some of today’s largest attention merchants. Despite their lucrative business model, systemic change is needed. To quote him once more, William James once said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch-goddess success. That – with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word ‘success’ – is our national disease.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We must ask whether these tech giants are successful in a way that is commensurate with the needs of society, or if they’re just rich from exploiting the society they’re embedded in. There is a world in which the technology we use helps us achieve our deeper goals rather than subverting them, but that is a world we must build together, and that will take a lot of attention.</p>
