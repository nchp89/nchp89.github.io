title: 'PRISM'
---


Starting as a research project with ATLAS faculty member Dr. Annie Margaret at the University of Colorado - Boulder, this project contributed to the founding of the non-profit organization [Post-Internet Project](https://postinternetproject.org) and is now in development for full integration into the platform. Beta testing starts in May 2024. In my ongoing work with the Post-Internet Project I own and manage the PRISM project. In this role I manage a small team of developers, develop the PRISM website via web development and content production, and provide data analysis and modeling for product development and enhancement.

### What is it?
PRISM is an educational experience intended to help young people who show signs of social media addiction. PRISM focuses on education, agency, and self-directed change to improve personal relationships with social technologies (e.g., smartphones, social media, etc.). It is based on scientific research and has been proven to be an effective intervention for reducing addiction levels of social media use. Much of the work that led to the instantiation of PRISM has roots in my prior work which can be found in the SMC Analysis and SMC Annotations projects on the Home page.

### How does it work?
With PRISM, participants undertake a social media challenge, where they spend time reflecting on their current relationship with social media and set their own goals for changes they would like to make. Over the course of four weeks, participants i) self-report their success in adhering to their goals, ii) reflect on their feelings and experiences, and iii) complete surveys related to social media addiction and other mental health outcomes, all while learning about the complexities of modern technology, human psychology, and healthy behaviors.

Key research questions that informed PRISM development:
1. How do specific social media behaviors relate to outcomes of wellbeing?
2. What strategies are most and least effective at engendering improvement with social media?
3. What patterns do we see among participants that may shed light onto specific strategies of change that would be most effective, and can we predict what those strategies would be for new participants?
