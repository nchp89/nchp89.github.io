<p>Our daily data ingests (mostly from SAP, but other sources as well) required that over 150 tables be up-to-date every morning that we came into work. The process our team was using to this point was painfully slow, taking nearly 22 hours to complete. Myself and a fellow team member rewrote the ingest process from the bottom up. We used parallel processing to ingest smaller tables in parallel, and for large tables implemented a delta process where only records that had been changed or added were ingested rather than the entire data source.</p>

<p>This drastically reduced the time taken for daily data ingestion from 22 hours to around 7 hours. With this improvement, the team was able to build new dashboards in Qlik that could provide other teams within the business up-to-date information to assist their needs.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Hunkins</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my professional experience working as a Sr Advanced Analytics Developer at Graybar Electric, I took on several roles ranging from data analysis to data engineering.

<p>I remember stepping off the jetway into Lambert Airport in St. Louis, MO. The feeling was surreal. It was March of 2017 and I had just spent the last 13 months teaching English in South Korea.</p>

<p>The feeling of coming back home was a complicated one, a swirling mixture of sadness for the end of an amazing journey and excitement for the beginning of a new one. Soon I would see my family members who had been mere faces on a screen for the past year. Soon I would see my friends and learn about what they had been up to since I’d been gone. Soon I would be broke.</p>

<p>While Korea was a life-changing experience, it certainly was not a profitable one. I had a few thousand dollars saved. It was enough to last me four months if I stretched, but I needed more. I needed a job.</p>

<h4 id="launchcode">LaunchCode</h4>

<p>Luckily for me I had wisely chosen to study math and computer science in college, so I actually had a foundation of technical skills that could be cultivated to start a career. Plus, while I had been overseas I started to read about this new thing called “Data Science.” I wasn’t really sure what it meant exactly (I still wonder sometimes), but I knew it involved working with math, machine learning, and computers. Naturally, I was intrigued, so I began studying a little bit each day before going to work.</p>

<p>When I came back home I learned about a non-profit organization called <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a> through a friend of mine. Their mission was to get people working in tech based on their skills rather than their degrees. I put together a couple of sample projects to show what I could do and applied to their program. I was overjoyed when they accepted my application. Eventually they offered to place me in a 90-day internship in a new data science team at Graybar Electric, and I happily accepted!</p>

<h4 id="graybar">Graybar</h4>

<p>Those first few months at Graybar were spent cutting my teeth on code and collaboration. What I learned most during that time was just how different industry work operated compared to academic work. There weren’t any classes or grades or clubs. There was just our team and the projects that the team needed to get done.</p>

<p>I loved collaborating with others on difficult problems, and I could tell that I was learning quickly. I was lucky to find myself among a young and scrappy team, made up of other people like me who wanted to learn and prove they could do this kind of work well. It was composed of misfits who had tried their hand in some other discipline before pivoting into the exciting new field of data science, and at the head of this motley crew was my boss, Jeremy Salazar, who was the scrappiest of us all.</p>

<p>I truly enjoyed those first months working at Graybar, and I guess I proved something to them, because they offered me a job at the end of the internship. Less than 6 months after coming home, I had started a career in data science.</p>

<h4 id="gratitude">Gratitude</h4>

<p>As I write about this time in my life, I’m overcome with a sense of gratitude for having gotten the chances that have gotten me to where I am today. I was the beneficiary of the opportunities presented by Korea, LaunchCode, and Graybar, and I will always be grateful for having received them. After working at Graybar for a few years, another opportunity presented itself. I moved to Boulder, CO to begin a graduate education in Computer Science, but that’s for another post.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nick Hunkins</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming Back Home]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">nickhunkins.com Is Under Construction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/test-post" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="nickhunkins.com Is Under Construction" /><published>2024-03-29T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-03-29T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/test-post</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/test-post"><![CDATA[<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>

<p>As always, Jekyll offers support for GitHub Flavored Markdown, which allows you to format your posts using the <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown syntax</a>. Examples of these text formatting features can be seen below. You can find this post in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory.</p>

<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic Formatting</h2>

<p>With Markdown, it is possible to emphasize words by making them <em>italicized</em>, using <em>astericks</em> or <em>underscores</em>, or making them <strong>bold</strong>, using <strong>double astericks</strong> or <strong>double underscores</strong>. Of course, you can combine those two formats, with both <em><strong>bold and italicized</strong></em> text, using any combination of the above syntax. You can also add a strikethrough to text using a <del>double tilde</del>.</p>

<h2 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h2>

<p>This is what a paragraph looks like. For the purpose of demonstration, the rest of this paragraph and the next paragraph after will mean absolutely nothing. Proin eget nibh a massa vestibulum pretium. Suspendisse eu nisl a ante aliquet bibendum quis a nunc. Praesent varius interdum vehicula. Aenean risus libero, placerat at vestibulum eget, ultricies eu enim. Praesent nulla tortor, malesuada adipiscing adipiscing sollicitudin, adipiscing eget est. Praesent nulla tortor, malesuada adipiscing adipiscing sollicitudin, adipiscing eget est.</p>

<p>Proin eget nibh a massa vestibulum pretium. Suspendisse eu nisl a ante aliquet bibendum quis a nunc. Mauris lobortis nulla et felis ullamcorper bibendum. Phasellus et hendrerit mauris. Proin eget nibh a massa vestibulum pretium. Suspendisse eu nisl a ante aliquet bibendum quis a nunc. Praesent varius interdum vehicula. Aenean risus libero, placerat at vestibulum eget, ultricies eu enim. Praesent nulla tortor, malesuada adipiscing adipiscing sollicitudin, adipiscing eget est.</p>

<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> to create headings. Multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">##</code> in a row denote smaller heading size. The following demonstrate the full range of heading sizes:</p>

<h1 id="heading-one-h1">Heading One (h1)</h1>

<h2 id="heading-two-h2">Heading Two (h2)</h2>

<h3 id="heading-three-h3">Heading Three (h3)</h3>

<h4 id="heading-four-h4">Heading Four (h4)</h4>

<h5 id="heading-five-h5">Heading Five (h5)</h5>

<h6 id="heading-six-h6">Heading Six (h6)</h6>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<p>You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in square brackets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ ]</code>, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">( )</code>. For example, it is very easy to <a href="http://google.com">link to Google!</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h2>

<p>Blockquotes are useful for denoting quotes, or highlighting a large block of text. Single line blockquote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This quote will change your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multi line blockquote with a cite reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="code-and-syntax-highlighting">Code and Syntax Highlighting</h2>

<p>Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn’t. However, many renderers - like GitHub or most Jekyll themes - support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. You can find the full list of supported programming languages <a href="https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers">here</a>. Also, it is possible to do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline code blocks</code>, by wrapping the text in ` ` ` quotations.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="c1">// Example can be run directly in your JavaScript console</span>

<span class="c1">// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">adder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">a</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">b</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">return a + b</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// Call the function</span>
<span class="nf">adder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// &gt; 8</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Another option is to embed your code through <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/gist/">Gist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="unordered-and-numbered-lists">Unordered and Numbered Lists</h2>

<p>You can make an unordered and nested list by preceding one or more lines of text with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code>, and indenting sublists. The following lists show the full range of possible list formats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>List item one
    <ul>
      <li>List item one
        <ul>
          <li>List item one</li>
          <li>List item two</li>
          <li>List item three</li>
          <li>List item four</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>List item two</li>
      <li>List item three</li>
      <li>List item four</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>List item two</li>
  <li>List item three</li>
  <li>List item four</li>
</ul>

<p>Numbered lists are made by using numbers instead of bullet points.</p>

<ol>
  <li>List item one
    <ol>
      <li>List item one
        <ol>
          <li>List item one</li>

          <li>List item three</li>
          <li>List item four</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>List item two</li>
      <li>List item three</li>
      <li>List item four</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>List item two</li>
  <li>List item three</li>

<h2 id="mathjax-example">MathJax Example</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a> is a partial differential equation that describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time:</p>

\[i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)\]

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Millennial">Joseph-Louis Millennial</a> was an Italian mathematician and astronomer who was responsible for the formulation of Lagrangian mechanics, which is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics.</p>

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac {\partial  L}{\partial \dot{q}_j} \right ) =  \frac {\partial L}{\partial q_j}\]
