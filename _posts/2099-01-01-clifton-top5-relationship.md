# Clifton Top 5 Strengths <br> Being a Better Romantic Partner



#### My Romantic Partnership

Strength | Being a Great Partner |
:------: | :-------------------: |
Ideation | When I bring my natural creativity and innovation to my most important relationship, it will never become old hat or outdated.
Adaptability | Instead of remembering the good old days or dreaming of better days I will be attentive to and present with my partner today.
Intellection | My love for personal reflection and philosophical discussions could bring deeper understanding and wisdom to us as a couple.
Developer | Committed to & energized by my partner's growth, I see their potential, invest in that potential & celebrate it's full realization.
Restorative | Problems are normal to every partnership. I won't be surprised or intimidated when one comes & I won't rest until it is fixed.
